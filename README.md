## 4 Conclusions 
  1) Based on the data from Restaurants, we calculated an average of 36.60079 minutes of cooktime across all restaurants
  2) When we plot the Rating vs Votes, we see that Restaurants with IDs 4728, 383, 1166, 1064 are the best ones with both very high ratings as well as votes
  3) When we plot the Rating vs Cooktime to analyze the relationship between the ratings and the cooktime of restaurants, we see that extremely high cooking time tend to yield lower ratings for cooktimes at and above 120 minutes and very good rating numbers for cooktimes below 10 minutes
  4) When we plot the Rating vs Average Cost to analyze the relationship between the ratings and the average cost of restaurants, we see that there is a cluster in the middle area with a large number of restaurants which means that an average of $30-60 average cost restaurants receives an average rating of 3.5-4.5. Although, high price does not guarantee exteremely high ratings, high average cost restaurants tend to receive ratings above 3.5 which can be considered at least not bad.
